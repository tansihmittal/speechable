### What languages are supported?
Speechable supports 12 languages: English (US & UK), German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

### Will this slow down my website?
No. The TTS processing happens in the browser when generating audio in the admin. The frontend player is lightweight and only loads on posts with audio.

### Can visitors download the audio?
Yes! There's a download button on the player that lets visitors save the audio file.

### Does word highlighting work on all themes?
Word highlighting works with most themes. It automatically detects your content area and highlights words as they're spoken.

### Is the audio stored on my server?
Yes, the generated audio is stored as post meta data. This ensures fast playback without regenerating audio each time.

### Can I customize the player appearance?
Yes! You can customize colors for the background, buttons, progress bar, text, and word highlighting. You can also adjust the border radius.

## 🔒 Privacy
